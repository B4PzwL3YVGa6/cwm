This is a port of OpenBSD's excellent cwm[0] to Linux and other
Unices.

    cwm is a window manager for X11 which contains many features that
    concentrate on the efficiency and transparency of window
    management.  cwm also aims to maintain the simplest and most
    pleasant aesthetic.

This port requires pkg-config, Xft, Xinerama and Xrandr.  The included
Makefile should work with both GNU make and BSD make.

This version actively tracks changes in the OpenBSD CVS repository.
